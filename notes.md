# Motivations

Taking this course to be part of something greater than we have right now. Too much unfairness in the system and hidden things, taken out by the the Web3 movement and community.I am sick of classical industries, I want to be part of a new movement!

Security is something that suits me more than being a creative founder. I like problem solving, something that I learned from science. Following specs, building with no real meaning is not my thing, while discovering new things and bring solutions after serious investigation.

Family is important to me so I need a job where the income is sufficient to bring joy to them. I also want to be available for them, work is important but I want to be physically there so independance and full remote are 'must have' for me.
